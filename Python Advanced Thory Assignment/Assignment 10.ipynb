    "\n",
    "Ans>> The properties are much simpler to use and understand. Simply says it can convert the method as an attribute. Like we have a method in our class and if we add `@property` as a decorator of that function then we can use that function or method as an attribute means we no longer need to use () like calling a function.\n",

    "Q4. What are the key differences in functionality between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> When we create class and there are some attributes also present, and some time we call them for our purpose, the `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are control that property of class.\n",
    "For calling the attribute we use this structure `class_instance.attribute_name` Now here we can tell the class how to deal with attributes which is doesn’t exist or not defined in the class creation time. Python will call `__getattr__` in that situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we need to catch every attribute nomatter that is defined or not, in that time `__getattribute__` will be called. The difference is that `__getattr__` only gets called for attributes that don't actually exist. If you set an attribute directly, referencing that attribute will retrieve it without calling `__getattr__`.  No matter what `__getattribute__` is called all the times when we call attributes from class instance.\n",
