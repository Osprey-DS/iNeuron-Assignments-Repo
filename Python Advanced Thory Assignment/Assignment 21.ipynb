    "### Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> Probablity distribution is the distribution of data in such a way that they are distrubuted based on the probability of occurence of different outcomes in the experiment. The predicted values are the probability occurrence of the outcomes. They can be find out by using some probability density function formulae. This will give the prabability of occurrence of the outcome."

The outputs of these true randome numbers cannot be determined, even if their internal structure and response history are known. While, the Pseudo-random numbers are generated by using some sort of algorithms and the sequences of these numbers are completly predictable."

If we plot this using histogram we find that it is normally distributed. This is refer to the probability distribution.\n",
