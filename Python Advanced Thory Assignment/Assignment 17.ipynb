    "### Q6. In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>>  This is used if the next element of our match is as per the requirement described in regex. It matches for the element or the characters but after matching, gives it up and returns only if there is a match or no match hence that is why these are called an assertion. They only assert if in a given test string the match with certain conditions is possible or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative look-ahead is used when we want to match something not followed by something else. In this type of lookahead, the regex engine searches for a particular element which may be a character or characters or a group after the item matched. If that particular element is not present then the regex declares the match as a match otherwise it simply rejects that match. \n",
    "\n",

If that particular element is present then the regex declares the match as a match otherwise it simply rejects that match.\n"
