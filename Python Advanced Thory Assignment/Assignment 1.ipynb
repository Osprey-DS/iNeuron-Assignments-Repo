    "## What is the main point of OOP in Python?\n",
    "Ans>> The main point of OOP in python is creating class object\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is  user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP is followed for the code reusebility, and our code and variable or attribute stay more secure than flat scripting code. here python gives us the flexiblity to hide and protect some variable and also we can bind user to use the attribute and change the value of certain attributes. "

    "\n",
    "Ans>> The `__init__` method is nothing but a Constructors, constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object."
