    "Ans>> The operator overloading works based of python default behavior, like, if our two object is string then it will perform string addition just like in normal python, and if our two object is number then it will perform the math operation between two objects. So, overall the operator overloading will works based on operands and objects."

    "Ans>> Operator overloading is ment to use when we define the datatype of any ibject before performing oprerator overloading, because it is works like normal python operator, if objects are string and operator are plus `+` then it will perform string concatenation, and if object are number then it will sum them up, so we have to predefine object datatype, and in that case we should use iperator overloading.\n",
