    "### Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> The python `logging` module helps us to create very flexible way to track our code exceptions, in logging methode there are many way to get information from the `exceptions`, like time(`%(asctime)s`), when the error occured, function name(`%(funcName)s`), like from which function the exception came, and time, and many more. by using that  library we can attach as many context as we want on our exception artifacts. these all are called `log record attribute` and help devoloper to add context."
