    "### Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> When we inherit from more than one class,  to make our child class that is called multiple inheritances, it is a way to achieve the re-usability of code as one child class can derive the properties of another class.\n",
    "But Note here the child class will look for the first entered parent class for the calling feature, if it found the feature or the methods it is looking for then it will not go on to the second parent class.\n"

    "### Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> The whole concept of composition is to use one class method to create for another class similar method, where we don’t need to write explicit code for a second class method. A composition means having a container object that contains other objects. It also can describe a class that references one or more objects of other classes in an instance variable. This allows us to model has association between objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is some advantage of composition. \n",
    "Reuse of existing code. Designing clean APIs, change the implementation of a class used in a composition without adapting any external clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example can describe composition better...\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans>> The bound method are those are bounded with class instances, if a function is an attribute of class and it is accessed via the instances, they are called bound method. A bound method has ‘self’ at its first argument means it is defining the self or class instance property. As these methods are dependent on the instance of classes this is also called the instance method.\n",

This is required for when we are trying to create a large and complex application. Although it can be useful there if we need some attribute for calculation and we don’t user to access them.\n",
