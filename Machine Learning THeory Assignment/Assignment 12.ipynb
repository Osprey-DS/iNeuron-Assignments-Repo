    "\n",
    "Ans>> The Naïve Bayes is classification algorithm. It is worked on the ‘probability’ formula or rule. The Naïve Bayes classifier is worked on the ‘Bayes Theorem’ which relies on conditional probability. And use the Bayes theorem as core algorithm, it named because it considers every feature independent from each other. That is why it is called `Naïve`.\n"

    "Ans>> Bayesian learning gives us many useful advantages like it is very flexible. Each row of our training data can incrementally be increased or decreased the estimated probability that a hypothesis is correct. This is provided more flexible methods for better those algorithms those are completely removed the hypothesis if it found to inconsistent with a single instance\n",
