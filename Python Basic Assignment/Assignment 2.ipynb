Equal sign(==) is used when we want to tell the computer to match two expressions and check whether these two expressions meet or not. if meet then return True. And in the opposite site the assignment operator(=) is used when we assign some value to a variable like (a=10), here we can use it as ‘a’ like it’s integer value 10 and perform necessary operations.  Like a+2 and it will return 12 (10+2)\n"
