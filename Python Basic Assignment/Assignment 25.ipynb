    "## 4. What does a yield statement do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. When we replace return with yield in a function, it causes the function to hand back a generator object to its caller. In effect, yield will prevent the function from exiting, until the next time **next()** is called."
