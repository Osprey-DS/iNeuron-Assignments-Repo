    "Ans>> The raw string is used in writing regex object to solve the problem of some special inbuilt character which is required the escape character or the backslash(\\)), to overcome this problem we use the raw string or simply put ‘r’ just before the start of the string or the quotation marks. After using raw string we don’t need to escape characters to use those special characters.\n",
