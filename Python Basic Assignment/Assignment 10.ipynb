    "\n",
    "Ans>> The `shutil.copy()` use for copying a single file where `shutil.copytree()` can copy the entire folder along with all subfolders inside it.\n"

    "### 2. What is the name of the feature used to rename files?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> In python we can use `os.rename` function to do the renaming of the file name. we have to pass the source and destination path(absolute) and we can change the file name in the destination. Both these are strings. Then the function will change the existing file name with a newely entered name.\n"

    "### 3. How are the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans>> The shutil module will delete the file completely and will free up space. This means we canâ€™t become the file after we delete with `os.unlike()` function. But if we use a third-party library called send2trash then instead of removing the file from our computer it will send it to our recycle bin and if we have to then we can recover or restore the deleted file from the recycle bin. These are the main difference between them.\n"
